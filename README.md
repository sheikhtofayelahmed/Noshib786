The layout uses bold colors, dynamic animations, and interactive elements to create an engaging, immersive experience for users. It is built with high contrast for readability and enhanced with hover effects to maintain a fast-paced, interactive feel, ideal for gaming-related platforms.

## **Color Palette & Mood:**

### **Background Gradient:**

- **Borders & Shadows** – These design elements add depth to the table, emphasizing the data and enhancing the immersive experience.

### **Data Formatting:**
